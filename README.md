## Elevator Pitch

<b>A platform for your programming project ideas - at every stage of the build process.</b>
<p>Web Bakers is an ideas kitchen in a sharing economy. Contribute your vision, discuss common challenges, and collaborate with other developers and designers on the projects that inspire you. Struggling with your own great idea? <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/">Exercise your idea muscle.</a></p>

## Brief

<b>The goals of this project are as follows:</b>
    <ul>
        <li> Provide a collaborative and creative outlet for developers, designers and other ideators via a responsive web app.</li>
        <li>Create a working MVP with a UI that is clean, simple and easy to navigate.</li>
        <li>Ensure the success of our goals and ease of future additions by following collaboration best practices.</li>
    </ul>

We are targeting developers, designers, and other creative types (collectively referred to as <em>ideators</em>) that have a vision for new projects and application ideas.  

<p>Our ideator audience includes teens and adults of any socioeconomic class, age, race, ability level and skill level who have access to a mobile device or computer.  Although our core developer team is based in North America, geographic location for our users is unlimited, and we encourage international participation.</p>

<p>Web Bakers ideators will be able to access the app through our website on a computer, smartphone, or tablet.  At this time, we do not anticipate creating a version for download as a mobile app.  We hope to achieve a clean, modern, look and feel.  Functionality and ease of use are the main UI goals.  We are inspired to design a user-friendly interface for communicating ideas that is similar in feel and function to reddit.</p>
