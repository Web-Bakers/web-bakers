## Elevator Pitch

<b>A platform for your programming project ideas - at every stage of the build process.</b>
<p>Web Bakers is an ideas kitchen in a sharing economy. Contribute your vision, discuss common challenges, and collaborate with other developers and designers on the projects that inspire you. Share your successes and see how other developers approached the same problem.  Struggling with your own great idea? <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/">Exercise your idea muscle.</a></p>

## Brief

<b>The goals of this project are as follows:</b>
    <ul>
        <li> Provide a collaborative and creative outlet for developers, designers and other ideators via a responsive web app.</li>
        <li>Create a working MVP with a UI that is clean, simple and easy to navigate.</li>
        <li>Ensure the success of our goals and ease of future additions by following collaboration best practices.</li>
    </ul>

We are targeting developers, designers, and other creative types (collectively referred to as <em>ideators</em>) that have a vision for new projects and application ideas.  

<p>Our ideator audience includes teens and adults of any socioeconomic class, age, race, ability level and skill level who have access to a mobile device or computer.  Although our core developer team is based in North America, geographic location for our users is unlimited, and we encourage international participation.</p>

<p>Web Bakers ideators will be able to access the app through our website on a computer, smartphone, or tablet.  At this time, we do not anticipate creating a version for download as a mobile app.  We hope to achieve a clean, modern, look and feel.  Functionality and ease of use are the main UI goals.  We are inspired to design a user-friendly interface for communicating ideas that is similar in feel and function to reddit.</p>

## Technologies Used

For this project, we are using the MEN stack. 

1. Javascript
2. Express
3. Node
4. MongoDB

Currently, we are running the app locally, but have a stretch goal of deployment on Heroku coming soon!
